# Hi, I'm Ryan

I'm a Post-Baccalaureate Researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory. I work on the Test Engineering - Data Analysis team researching generative AI for waveform synthesis and building sowftware tools for data analysis.

Prior to Los Alamos, I studied computer science at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, with minors in AI, data science, math and music.  

In my free time, I enjoy swimming, running, chess, Rubik's cubes, music, video games and entomology
