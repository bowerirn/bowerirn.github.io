# Hi, I'm Ryan

I'm a computer science PhD student at University of Rochester, studying computer audition with Dr. Zhiyao Duan.  

Prior to Rochester, I studied computer science at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, with minors in AI, data science, math and music, then did research at Los Alamos National Laboratory on using AI to generate shock waveforms.  

In my free time, I enjoy swimming, running, chess, Rubik's cubes, music, video games and entomology
